/* 
The accentColor in Flutter's ThemeData is a color that represents an accent or complementary color to the primary color. It is often used for highlighting certain elements in your app's user interface to create visual interest and guide the user's attention.

For instance, you might use the accentColor for things like buttons, switches, sliders, and other interactive elements that you want to stand out from the rest of the UI. This color helps create a consistent and visually appealing design by ensuring that all interactive elements share a common color that contrasts well with the primary colors.

/*
In Flutter, you can define a color scheme using the ColorScheme class provided by the framework. This class encapsulates a set of colors that are commonly used in an app's user interface, such as primary, secondary, background, error, and text colors.
